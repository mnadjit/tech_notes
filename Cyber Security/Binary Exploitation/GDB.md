## GEF
### Install
https://hugsy.github.io/gef/install/
#### Linux
1) easy way: `bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gef.blah.cat/sh)"`
2) If the easy way didn't work, download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugsy/gef/main/gef.py into `~/.gdbinit-gef.py`
```sh
echo "source ~/.gdbinit-gef.py" >> /etc/gdb/.gdbinit
```
if `.gdbinit` is not found in the path above, try finding it using:
```sh
find / -name "*gdbinit*"
```
When you run GDB now GDF cli should show.
#### Windows
Haven't had any luck installing GEF in Windows 11 yet.
Download gef.py: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hugsy/gef/main/gef.py
In GDB shell you may type `pi` to enter Python cli, and based on GEF documentation you can try the following command:
```gdb
(gdb) pi
>>> gdb.execute('source %s' % '/path/to/gef.py')
```
